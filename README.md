# Task 07: Ethical Implications of Decision Making

This repository documents my research process and decision-making workflow for Research Task 7. The task focuses on generating a stakeholder-facing decision report based on LLM-generated narratives and emphasizes reproducibility, uncertainty analysis, and ethical implications.

## Repository Contents

- `stakeholder_report.md`: Final stakeholder report.
- `prompts.md`: LLM prompts, responses, and annotated edits.
- `data/`: Source dataset and metadata.
- `code/`: Notebooks/scripts used for data processing and validation.
- `outputs/`: Visualizations and LLM outputs.
- `logs/`: Prompt logs and process notes.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `code/preprocess_stats.ipynb` to clean and generate statistics.
2. Use `code/validate_narrative.ipynb` to validate LLM claims and compute uncertainty.
3. Review visualizations in `outputs/visualizations/`.
4. Read `stakeholder_report.md` for full findings and recommendations.

## Ethical Notes

All data is public and anonymized. All LLM output is labeled and verified manually. See `stakeholder_report.md` for further ethical evaluation.
